You're talking about a non-persistent cookie. 
By default asp.net sends cookies in that way. 
The main difference between them are that a persistent cookie has an expires value set.

So, if you don't want the cookie to persist, then do not set the expires value.

That said, the cookie will remain in memory until the browser is actually closed. 


It's important to note that these days you can't count on a session cookie being deleted when the user closes the browser. 
Both Chrome and Firefox made that change back in 2012 or so - see the various links at this answer.
